In the month of November 2019, I had multiple public speaking engagements within a very short time span - at the tightest, I delivered 5 talks in 10 days. That's one talk in 2 days! Here are the 3 main tactics I used to be prepared for the different content as well as the presentations themselves.

## The schedule

The timeline was extremely tight - I had to have all my slides ready way in advance. Also, on each of the days I had other presentations, I basically didn't have time to prepare for other presentations as I would get home exhausted. So between Nov 7 and 18, I barely had a moment to practice.

* Nov 7 - Modelling Seminar, Bell
* Nov 9 - Dames Making Games
* Nov 14 - PyLadies Toronto
* Nov 16 - PyCon Canada
* Nov 18 - A.I. Socratic Circles
* Nov 28 - A.I. Conference, Bell

## Tactic 1 - Do dry runs

This is the single reason I could finish preparation for the talks on time. I used to not have many dry runs in my talk preparations, and usually could deliver decent talks by "winging it" or getting prompted by my slide content.

Winging it often worked well enough, because I have pretty good experience speaking from giving tutorials at Rotman business school (as a teaching assistant), as well as multiple technical conference talks [in the past](https://www.susanshu.com/about){:target="_blank"}.

However I always had enough time to exclusively practice one presentation in the past, so being able to get to the point of mastery where I didn't have to think too much on stage, was crucial because of all the different topics I was giving in a short span of time.

It's tempting to not do serious dry runs - if I can deliver the talk by having read the slides thoroughly and thinking about it in my head, why go the extra mile?

The reason is that what makes a talk good is when the speaker has reached the point of mastery. I liken it to if I had to give a violin performance, and for weeks I only stare at the violin and think about the notes I will play. Then, on the day of the performance, I finally pick up the violin for the first time and play the notes out loud. This is basically the same as going into a public speaking engagement without having done dry runs. A skilled violinist could probably sight read a song (like reading content from slides) without making a "mistake", but it won't be as good a performance if they haven't picked up the violin to play the same song out loud prior.

I'm going to break down my dry run schedule for one of these talks, which was about reinforcement learning and recommender systems done on YouTube - a very technical topic. It was presented at A.I. Socratic Circles, which in addition has sections of the talk dedicated to audience questions and discussions. This meant that I had to know the content inside and out, and be able to deal with improvised content (not on the slide deck) that comes up organically during the presentation.

* Nov 5 - dry run with S.M., O.N.
* Nov 12 - dry run with ~5 coworkers
* Nov 13 - dry run with O.N., J.M.
* Nov 14 - dry run with N.P.
* Nov 17 - dry run with A.D.
* Nov 18 - day of the talk!

For this one talk, I did 5 dry runs to 10 people in total. To closely mimic the presentation format, I let them know they could ask questions at any point during my talk. I got a lot of practice answering questions from different people of varying understanding of reinforcement learning and recommender systems, which was amazing practice for answering technical theory at differing levels of depth that I had to come up on the fly. I'm very grateful to the individuals who lent me their time - each dry run was ~1 hour long!

Without dry runs, I couldn't have been able to react so well to the questions on this talk (the video is here). And they helped immensely for talks where I didn't have to have back and forth with the audience.

For PyCon Canada, I was going to be speaking to a very technical audience as well. There was also a very tight time limit to ensure the conference ran on schedule. So I practice multiple times alone with a stop watch and video recording - I could do them alone twice an evening and note down what parts to cut or speed up.

If it's difficult to get so many people like my A.I. Socratic Circles talk, another way I found useful was recording myself on video. I didn't end up watching the recordings fully at all, but having the video on forced me to give a real dry run (no random pauses to edit slides, or breaks, in order to mimic the true situation).

## Tactic 2 - get to an MVP slide deck as soon as possible

Apart from getting on stage and speaking, I spent *so much time* on making the content of the slides. Because some of my dry runs were scheduled up to 2 weeks before the respective talk dates, I had to ensure I had some bare bones content to present 2 weeks or more in advance.

I literally did not have time to make the most polished versions of the slides during those first dry runs, but that's the beauty of the "lean" model of product improvement - getting feedback from an MVP (minimum viable product, a concept popularized in the startup space by [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries](https://www.amazon.ca/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/){:target="_blank"}).

Because I used skeletons of content, I was able to iterate quickly on feedback before making things polished. If I had gotten the slides to 100% polish all before the dry runs, and then deleted or added slides according to the dry run feedback, I'll have wasted all the time I took to polish the slides. 

**Content improvement iteration first, then polish.**

## Tactic 3 - Slides matter for maximum effect

Look - I'm a technical person by training. I used LaTeX slide decks all through grad school so that math equations look pretty. They do not look pretty for presentations outside of the lecture hall, without careful deliberation.

The whole point of giving any talk is so that the audience can take away an idea or concept that I am explaining and sharing. If the below happens, I might as well have **wasted all my time giving the talk, as well as the audience's time**.

### How to waste everyone's time (do NOTs of public speaking)

Yes, the title of this sub-section is worded strongly, and I do have strong feelings about these points. You've encountered speakers like this, I've encountered speakers like these, we all have. So the following points should be a universal feeling.

1. Have slides so dense with words that the audience struggles to pick between reading the slides, or hearing you talk, to the point they fail to do either of them, or space out. I've heard talks like this where I felt it was a massive waste of everyone's time. I might as well read the slides at home. This style is common in lecture halls (and why I skipped class so often), but they don't belong in more public settings or to a mixed (e.g. technical and business mix) setting.
2. The speaker reads the slides verbatim - not feeling like a talk. Same as the previous point, I might as well read the slides at home if the talking portion isn't giving the audience any value for the time they spend physically being in that talk space.

So, what do these points have to do with my tactic of making the slides? I guess my point is that, in order to not waste my own time and the audience's time, the communication part has to be well executed. This means my words and slides should compliment and enhance each other so that the above 2 time-wasters don't happen. And, the more the above 2 time-wasters happen, the less the audience can understand my talk, and the less they walk away remembering my key points, which are the reasons I spent all that time preparing for the talks in the first place!

I'm not going to go into PowerPoint basics here, but I took this training, courtesy of my workplace - [PrezExpert](https://www.prezexpert.com/){:target="_blank"}

For a technical person like me, it was life-changing. I started to think of slides as complimentary to my talks, not something to get over with as soon as possible. They really matter for helping the audience understand me, be it a business or technical or mixed topic difficulty.

My main tips are:

1. Use headers to drive home the point of that slide

Instead of using headers as the title of a list of bullet points, basically have your conclusion of the slide in the header or kicker. If the audience only reads one thing on the slide (happens more often than not), and that's the header of the slide. It's precious real estate - and if they're starting to space out (bad) or focus on the presenter's words (good), they might as well at least have that takeaway.

2. Make your slides with the thought - how do I help the audience understand the point?

A talk is like a performance in a sense, but instead of, say, an instrument, you're doing the performance with words and visuals. The goal of this performance is for the audience to understand some topic, or even to be persuaded. The performance can be seen as a product in this sense, which is why I treat the slides and talk like an MVP, and get feedback aggressively. Following this logic, when creating the product, consisting of slides and words, thinking from the perspective of the user is important! I guess it's like user interface design and optimization...

I also read the book, [Talk like TED, by Carmine Gallo](https://www.amazon.ca/Talk-Like-TED-Public-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1250041120){:target="_blank"} to improve how my visual content and words could compliement each other to reach the audience. The book breaks down select TED talks, and so I watched the videos to get isolated observations that I could then use to improve my own talks.

## How I would improve my talks in the future

I feel that during this month of talks, I accomplished a lot, and got a lot of praise for my deliveries. For a technical topic I even got amazing feedback from business folks that they were able to follow the talk! I think that crafting the headers of the slides to have the high level conclusion really helped - even if they space out because of the math equations on my slides, they can get the reasons for using that algorithm, at least.

However, I'd really try to avoid such a busy schedule in the future, because my body really took a toll. I actually threw up for an hour the day before my last talk, and didn't sleep well. I had to take a nap in the conference green room on the day of that last talk... And then I got sick right after for a week. While I feel like I ate and slept at a normal schedule during the entire month, I didn't have time to take a break even on weekends, and that cause my body to be high strung for too long, and once I just relaxed it all, it hit me (the let-down effect). 

One more thing is that I aggressively asked for feedback, and was able to improve throughout the month. I think in the last talk, I wasn't maintaining my energy level, which was also a feedback I got during the month. (It also could have been due to the condition of my body and lack of sleep), but having been through this experience I hope to improve so I can avoid my energy level going down throughout a long talk.

Lastly, my time management and discpline tactics worked well - I had the image to the left as my phone wall paper for the entire month. It's a checklist of milestones such as when the dry runs were scheduled, when I planned to have the MVP slides done, and so on.
