## : this blog

I like to analyze what I do. I track my time and make spreadsheets. Why not write about what I learned?

## : me

Hi!

Currently I’m a data scientist in the telecommunications industry.

In the field of machine learning, I’m lead editor of the [A.I. Socratic Circles blog](https://aisc.a-i.science/blog/){:target="_blank"} (formerly Toronto Deep Learning Series), where we post explanations of new developments in the field from publications and conferences.

I enjoy volunteering to give back to the community - you can find me mentoring or speaking at various workshops around Toronto.

I’m also an indie game developer, having showcased my game in Bit Bazaar and Damage Camp, both gaming conferences held in Toronto.

I’m a 2-time speaker at Visual;Conference where I shared my knowledge on marketing on Steam as an indie dev, as well as my game development pipeline.

In a bit of a cross-over between these two fields, I attended the [Game Developers Conference](https://www.gdconf.com/){:target="_blank"} in 2018, 2019 (Thanks, [DMG](https://dmg.to/){:target="_blank"}!), and was part of the [AI Roundtable: Expert session](http://www.gameai.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I love what I do, and what gets me up every day is that I have much, much more to learn!
