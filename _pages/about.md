## : this blog

I like to analyze what I do. I track my time and make spreadsheets. Why not write about what I learned?

Hi!

Currently I’m a data scientist in the telecommunications industry.

In the field of machine learning, I’m head editor of the [A.I. Socratic Circles blog](https://aisc.a-i.science/blog/){:target="_blank"} (formerly Toronto Deep Learning Series), spoke to an audience of hundreds as a [Toronto Data Science & Big Data Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tordatascience/){:target="_blank"} panelist, and presented a modelling seminar + facilitated an AISC talk, both on [reinforcement learning in Go](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/){:target="_blank"}.

To give back to professionals and students interested in the field, I’ve been a judge for the [Call of Data](https://acorntalent.io/callofdata){:target="_blank"} datathon hosted by AcornTalent and PagerDuty, and mentor for multiple AI, ML, and Python workshops at [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/){:target="_blank"}.

I’m also an indie game developer, having showcased my game in Bit Bazaar and Damage Camp, both gaming conferences held in Toronto.

I’m a 2-time speaker at Visual;Conference where I shared my knowledge on marketing on Steam as an indie dev, as well as my game development pipeline.

In a bit of a cross-over between these two fields, I attended the [Game Developers Conference](https://www.gdconf.com/){:target="_blank"} in 2018, 2019 (Thanks, [DMG](https://dmg.to/){:target="_blank"}!), and was part of the [AI Roundtable: Expert session](http://www.gameai.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I love what I do, and what gets me up every day is that I have much, much more to learn!
